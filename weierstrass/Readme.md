## Overview
This repository contains two MATLAB scripts for analyzing the Weierstrass function, a classic example of a fractal curve. The first script computes the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative of the Weierstrass function using its analytic term-by-term expression and generates a plot and data file. The second script estimates the fractal (box-counting) dimension of the derivative's graph from the generated data.

These scripts are designed for educational or research purposes in fractional calculus and fractal geometry. They assume MATLAB R2020a or later (for `exportgraphics`).

## Script 1: `weierstrass_fractional_derivative.m`
### Purpose
Computes the Weierstrass function W(x) = sum from n=0 to N-1 of a^n * cos(b^n * pi * x) and its Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative of order alpha, D^alpha W(x) = sum from n=0 to N-1 of a^n * (b^n * pi)^alpha * cos(b^n * pi * x + alpha * pi / 2), over x in [0, 2]. Plots the function (red) and derivative (blue), saves the plot as `plot.png` (2400x1800 pixels), and exports the derivative values to `values.csv`.

### Key Parameters
- `a = 0.5`: Scaling factor (0 < a < 1).
- `b = 3`: Frequency multiplier (integer >1; ab >1 for convergence).
- `N = 20`: Number of terms (increase for better approximation; e.g., 30+ for finer detail).
- `alpha = 0.2`: Fractional order (0 < alpha < 1).
- Domain: `x = linspace(0, 2, num_points)` (default 1000; increase to 100000 for high resolution).

### Outputs
- `plot.png`: Plot without title or legend, x-label "x", no y-label.
- `values.csv`: Two columns (x, D^alpha W(x)).

### Usage
Run the script in MATLAB. Adjust parameters as needed. For higher resolution, set `x = linspace(0, 2, 100000);` (may require more memory).

### Notes
- Uses finite truncation; errors decrease geometrically (e.g., max error ~10^(-4) for derivative at N=20).
- The analytic expression for the fractional derivative is obtained by term-by-term application of the standard Riemann-Liouville derivative formula for cosine functions [1].
- Plot saved with exact pixel dimensions via `exportgraphics`.

## Script 2: `fractal_dimension_estimate.m`
### Purpose
Estimates the box-counting (Hausdorff) dimension of the graph of D^alpha W(x) from `values.csv` using a vertical-span method: divides x into boxes of size epsilon, counts y-boxes needed per x-box, and fits the slope of log N(epsilon) vs. log(1/epsilon).

### Key Parameters
- `numSizes = 8`: Number of epsilon values.
- epsilon range: Geometric sequence from `dx/50` to `dx/5` (dx = domain width; focuses on self-similar regime to avoid sampling artifacts).

### Inputs
- `values.csv` (generated by Script 1).

### Outputs
- Console: Estimated dimension and R^2 of fit (>0.99 expected).
- `dimension_fit.png`: Log-log plot (2400x1800 pixels) with data points (red), fit line (blue), legend, and grid.

### Usage
1. Run Script 1 to generate `values.csv`.
2. Run this script in MATLAB. Higher point count in Script 1 improves accuracy.

### Notes
- Analytic dimension: D = 2 + (ln(a) / ln(b)) + alpha, where the increase by alpha reflects the added roughness from the fractional derivative [2].
- Numerical estimate approaches analytic value with finer sampling but plateaus due to truncation (N=20 sufficient; no need for N=50).
- R^2 indicates fit quality; if <0.95, increase points in Script 1.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB base (no toolboxes required; `polyfit` is core functionality).

## Example Results
- At 100k points with alpha = 2: Dimension ≈1.54.
- Plot shows linear scaling in intermediate epsilon regime.
