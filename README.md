## README
This repository contains MATLAB and PYTHON code for experiments with fractional calculus and fractal geometry. All code has been developed and tested with AI assistance from Gemini and Grok.

It is divided in subrepositories that start from basics (rlfractionalderivative) and move to more advanced topics (fractalinterpretation and fractalinterpretation-fbm).

The results confirm that fractional integrals can be interpreted as integrals restricted to lacunary fractal subsets of the real line with fractal dimension equal to the order of fractional integration $\alpha$ (0 < $\alpha$ < 1).

The cases examined are: integrals restricted to Cantor set-like fractals (fractalinterpretation); and exepcted values of integrals restricted to the zero sets of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with Hurst parameter H = 1 - $\alpha$, over many fBm realizations (fractalinterpretation-fbm).

This confirms there's a deep link between fractional calculus and fractal geometry.
