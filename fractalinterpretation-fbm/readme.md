This subrepository fractalinterpretation-fbm continues the exploration of the geometrical meaning of fractional diffintegral operators and its relation with fractal geometry, started in the subrepository fractalinterpretation.

There I suggested to interpret the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral of order alpha (0 < alpha < 1) of a smooth function as the integral of the function restricted to a fractal subset of the x axis with fractal dimension alpha. This is illustrated with fractal subsets of the x axis constructed as Cantor set-like fractals with dimension alpha. This interpretation has been suggested by Nigmatullin, who "*interpreted the fractional integral in terms of the fractal Cantor set... the fractional index of integration equals the fractal dimension of the Cantor set*." (Ref. Zhmakin 2023).

Intuitively, fractional integration of order alpha (0 < alpha < 1) is something in between no integration (order zero) and full integration (order one). No integration returns a one-dimensional line (the function itself), and full integration returns a two-dimensional area. Fractional integration adds alpha to the dimension of the original function and returns a fractal entity with dimension 1 + alpha. Or alternatively (but equivalently), fractional integration should be viewed as partial (as opposed to full) integration restricted to only a subset of the x axis, and a fractal subset seems the most general and robust choice. 

Here I generalize from Cantor sets to random fractal subsets of the x axis. The zero set of a fractional Brownian motion (fBm, Ref. Mandelbrot 1982, Mandelbrot & Van Ness 1968) is a random fractal subset of the x axis. So, the idea is that the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral of order alpha (0 < alpha < 1) of a smooth function can be interpreted as the expected value (over many fBm realizations) of the integral of the function restricted to the zero set of fBm with Hurst parameter H = 1 - alpha.

As alpha tends to one, the zero-set becomes "dense," approaching a full one-dimensional line, which corresponds to standard integration. As alpha tends to zero, the zero-set becomes "sparse," approaching a collection of isolated points, which corresponds to no integration (returning the original function).

## AI assistance

I developed this with AI assistance from Gemini and Grok. I used Python because both Gemini and Grok can execute Python code directly. This subrepository contains separate README files and Python scripts developed with AI assistance from Gemini and Grok. It is interesting that the two AI assistants chose slightly different (but equivalent) mathematical and programming methods.

Beyond the mathematics, this repository serves as a case study in AI-assisted "vibe" math and coding. It is noteworthy that while the two assistants chose slightly different mathematical and programming methods - such as different ways of visualizing the zero-set - both converged on the same physical and numerical interpretation.

This document is deliberately a conceptual bird-view. Please see the README files (and references therein) and the Python scripts generated by Gemini and Grok for more explanations.

## Gemini-Grok paper

I invited both AI assistants to co-author a joint *arXiv*-style paper. A coin toss determined which AI assistant would write the initial draft. This document was then passed back and forth between Gemini and Grok, iterating through four cycles of critique and refinement. The paper, included in this subrepository, is titled "The Fractal Geometry of Fractional Calculus: Riemann-Liouville Integrals as Expected Local Times of Fractional Brownian Motion."
